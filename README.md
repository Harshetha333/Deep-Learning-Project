# YOLOv8 Object Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, which can identify and localize objects in images with high accuracy. This repository contains all the code, trained models, and documentation needed to set up, train, and deploy the object detection model.

## Contents
- `code/`: Contains all the source code for the project.
  - `main_code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the model training and evaluation process.
  - `deploy.py`: Script to deploy the trained model using Gradio for real-time object detection.
  - `best.pt`: Trained model weights.
- `data/`: Dataset used for model training.
  - `Images.zip`: Compressed file containing annotated images for training.
- `docs/`:
  - `Final_report.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the project methodology, network architecture, and results.
  - `deployment.mp4`: Video demonstration of the model deployment and its capabilities.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone (https://github.com/Harshetha333/Deep-Learning-Project)
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision gradio opencv-python
   ```
3. **Run the Deployment:**
   Navigate to the `code/` directory and run:
   ```
   python deploy.py
   ```

## Model Architecture
The YOLOv8 model is structured into three main components: the backbone for feature extraction, the neck for processing features, and the head for making final predictions. The model is trained on a custom dataset with extensive data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.

## Results
The trained model demonstrates high accuracy and real-time performance in object detection. Detailed performance metrics and evaluations are available in the `Final_report.pdf`.

## Demonstration
Check out `deployment.mp4` in the `docs/` directory for a live demonstration of the object detection model in action.
